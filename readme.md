Proof of Collateral is an open‑source toolkit for launching **100 % collateral‑backed tokens** that are immune to rug pulls and algorithmic death‑spirals.  
Inspired by the hard‑learned lessons of crypto scammers, *pump.fun* exits and the 2022 LUNC/UST collapse, we enforce:

* **Transparent audits** & open governance
