## Tiamat Digital Strategic Pivot — From Firebrand to Foundry

> *“From the chaos of Tiamat, the world was born. From the crash of LUNC, new strength arises.”*

Tiamat Digital now positions itself explicitly as the **Destroyer of exploitative crypto launch paradigms** and the **architect of Proof‑of‑Collateral (PoC) fair‑launch standards**. The lessons of *LUNC*’s algorithmic‑peg failure and the ceaseless conveyor of pump‑and‑dump schemes have galvanized our mandate:

1. **Eradicate Rug‑Pull Vectors** — Any mechanism that allows creators to withdraw collateral or liquidity without proportional token redemption is categorically rejected.
2. **Mandate Real, On‑chain Collateral** — Each Lunar Reserve‑issued token must be provably backed 1 : 1 (or better) by transparent reserves, locked in non‑custodial smart contracts.
3. **Premiums Fund Public Goods, Not Ponzis** — Optional mint‑time premiums (≤ 5 %) flow into a development & audit treasury governed by token holders—never private founders.
4. **Open‑Source & Audit‑First** — All contracts are MIT‑licensed and queued for third‑party formal verification *before* main‑net deployment.
5. **Community‑Governed Evolution** — Upgrades, fee tweaks, or collateral composition changes require on‑chain governance with delayed‑execution timelocks.

By welding these pillars into the Lunar Reserve framework, Tiamat Digital transmutes the ashes of prior failures into a hardened launchpad where fair value and verifiable security are non‑negotiable. The era of opaque treasuries and reflexive Ponzi premiums ends here; from this forge, a provably collateralized future begins.
